# Spline_trajectory_pose_plan

This poject provide an alternative solution for robots trajectory as well as pose planing using Spline and Squad.

The project aims to find out a solution for time optimization with soommth trajectory / linear velocity / angular velocity / pose trajectory

Results are as follow:

trajectoris and poses in 3D space:
